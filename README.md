# Getting Started

This project is for a technical assessment made by 
Vytautas Vėgėlė (vytautasveg at gmail dot com)

I have chosen to use Spring Boot as the basis for this blog web application,
as this tool already sets up most of the technologies mentioned in the assessment goals.
However, my only Java web application experience comes from the Akka framework, as I had no
previous experience in Java Spring, so it was an intense learning experience.

## Requirements

[Java 11](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/11/) and [Maven 3.6.3](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) is required to setup and run this project.
Here is the full environment used with the Java version:
```
Apache Maven 3.6.3
Maven home: /usr/share/maven
Java version: 11.0.9.1, vendor: Ubuntu, runtime: /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64
Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: UTF-8
OS name: "linux", version: "5.8.0-40-generic", arch: "amd64", family: "unix"
```

Commands used to install these tools:
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:openjdk-r/ppa
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk
sudo apt install maven
```

This project uses Spring Boot version 2.4.2. With some included configurations, the project uses the following technologies:
* H2 used as a data base in memory (default)
* Hibernate is used to communicate with the database (default)
* User sessions are used (default) and will deny access to blogs that do not belong to user
* Passwords are encrypted using BCryptPasswordEncoder

## Startup

Simply run it with maven using this command in project root where `pom.xml` is located:

`mvn spring-boot:run`

To run the unit tests for endpoints use

`mvn test -e`

# API usage (using cURL)

## Default data
If no users are specified in any repositories, the following users will be populated
* username: user1, password: p
* username user2, password: p

One can attempt to test functionality with cURL
##Step-by-step walktrough
### Register user
You can register a new user with
```
curl -i \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Content-Type:application/json" \
-X POST --data \
  '{"email": "test1", "password": "p"}' "http://localhost:8080/register"
```

### Login user
You can get a session started and saved to a file with
```
curl -i \
-H "Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
-c cookies.txt \
-X POST http://localhost:8080/login -d "username=test1&password=p"
```

### Create blog entry
Then use the same session to use the API. Start with creating a blog entry
```
curl -i -b cookies.txt \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Content-Type:application/json" \
-X POST --data \
'{"title": "testpost", "content": "sample content text"}' "http://localhost:8080/blogs"
```

### Browse blog entries
Review your blog entries
```
curl -i -b cookies.txt \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-X GET http://localhost:8080/blogs
```
This, due to requirements, will only return the blog entries owned by your currently logged-in user.

### Update blog entries
Update the title and content of your blog entry. If no other entries were added,
the id and the path should include the number '4'
```
curl -i -b cookies.txt \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Content-Type:application/json" \
-X PUT --data \
'{"title": "testpost", "content": "changed sample content text"}' \
"http://localhost:8080/blogs/4"
```

### Delete blog entry
```
curl -i -b cookies.txt \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-X DELETE http://localhost:8080/blogs/4
```

# Missing goals
## Optional
* Database versioning system: currently the project uses H2 in-memory storage, otherwise it would be more useful,
  if we were to change H2 to some relational or other database to store the jpa repositories.
* Enpoint unit testing: I had some troubles coding session storage for testing and opted-out from full testing, only leaving
simple controller calls that are expected to fail due to those operations requiring a session.
## Other 
* The is no email validation currently in the project.
* The spring boot was configured for a development environment without consideration to a production environment.
