# Getting Started

## Requirements

## Startup

## API testing
If no users are specified in any repositories, the following users will be populated
* username: bilbo, password: p
* username frodo, password: p

One can attempt to test functionality with cURL

You can register a new user with
```
curl -i \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Content-Type:application/json" \
-X POST --data 
  '{"email": "test1", "password": "p"}' "http://localhost:8080/register"
```

You can get a session started and saved to a file with
```curl -i \
-H "Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
-c cookies.txt \
-X POST http://localhost:8080/login -d "username=test1&password=p"
```
Then use the same session to use the API
`curl -i -b cookies.txt -X GET http://localhost:8080/blogs`
